The first USA Tour flight of 2016 brought us into the west coast once again. Following a similar plan to Leg 42nd, Leg 43rd was split in two halves, which curiously were flown between very disimilar terrains. The first half of leg 42nd over rugged appalacchian mountains, and the second half of leg 43rd over also rugged terrain above the Rocky Mountains and the Cascades. Contrastingly the second half of leg 42nd, and the first half of leg 43rd featured flatlands, the Ohio plains, and the great plains respectively.

But certainly, at FL340, the risky terrain of the Rocky mountains seemed tame, if not distant (Well, Side having engine problems on a 707 could see the peaks more intimately then). And only, during our last arrival, we got to approach and flirt the volcanic top of the Mount hood.

Well... USA tour leg 44rd will be a payback of the Rockies. This time, departing Portland, Oregon, we will head again towards the East, and face the Rocky Mountains. This time much closer to the ground, flying at a "low" altitude at 15000 ft.  We will be heading to Omaha, in the state of Nebraska, which lies on the great plains just after the Rocky mountains descend again, and the big valleys begin.

<h2>Aircrafts</h2>

The participant aircraft for Leg 44th is going to be any propeller aircraft capable of maintaining the suggested cruising conditions <b>and capable of flying the distance without need for a refill</b>. Long range propeller aircrafts maintaining altitude for at least 1200-1300 nm is, therefore required. this is an <u>hybrid leg</u>, so both Civilian and Military aircraft can co-participate.

Yes. Of course, we will need aircraft capable of doing at least 1200nm, but a bear and its impressive skill  is "off course", welcome ;) [<a href="https://github.com/FGMEMBERS/Tu-95MR">Newly reburfished by HerbyW</a>: Hint, hint]

Test your birds, and let us know what aircraft you will have the pleasure of flying and accompany us with. I'll be listing the confirmed aircraft list so everyone can be ready and prepared on the date.

Range of an aircraft is judged by published (or wiki) specifications, regardless of the aircraft's FG performance. But, your aircraft may require a fix on the fuel content or consumption to match the specifications, as well.

<h2>Route: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IAHM-COL/USATour-Screenshots/master/USATour44-KPDXKOMA/KPDXKOMA.gpx">GPX</a></h2>

In our flight towards Nebraska, we will have a VOR2VOR navigation route.

 Departing eastwards from Portland, we will face the rapidly climbing terrain, and approach the vicinity of both Mt. Hood and Mt. Jefferson, towards the fix RATTZ, and then head towards Kimberly VOR (IMB). Immediately after departure we will initiate a continuos climb to our cruise altitude at 15000 ft; keep in mind that Mt. Hood, briefly to your North will have a peak around 11200ft, so make sure to establish a good climbing profile and maintain a strict observance of the cleared route --which follows a lower valley between these two mountains.

After Kimberly, and well established in our navigation, we will follow J15 J163 adn J94 to O'Neill VOR, where we enter our arrival transition as we approach Eppley Field for an ILS - or a VORDME guided landing.
