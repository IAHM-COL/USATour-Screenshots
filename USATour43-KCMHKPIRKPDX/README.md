<b><h1>Charter Aviation I: The Jets</h1></b>

The fortieth-second USA tour leg arrived to the City of Columbus Ohio with an all Military squad of rotatory wing aircrafts. Alltough many of us are not frequently helicopter pilots, we did succeed in completing a two segments leg with an stopover the Appalachian Rgnl, on the state of West Virginia. The first segment featured mountaineous regions of the Southwest Appalachian Mountains, whereas the second segment feature the Allegheny flats, the Ohio valley, and some River sightseeings. In fact, really amazing screenshots were obtained and shared :)

The ride of the valkyrie (as the 42nd leg was entitled) was our last USA tour leg of 2015. But as the New Year 2016 enters, we will be preparing our continuing tour over every state and territory of the USA. This time, the leg 43rd, will depart Ohio back to the West Coast, on the State of Oregon, and the beautiful city of Portland. This time we will also have two segments featuring valleys and mountains -- but we will be flying confortably over altitude, and following  IFR rules.

<h2>Aircrafts</h2>

For the first USA tour event of 2016 -- scheduled on January 9th -- the topic selected is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_charter">Charter Aviation</a> - Jet engined Aircrafts. 

Participants will be flying any Jet Aircraft used by at least one charter company Worldwide. Noting that the range of possible aircraft is very wide, starting on very small business jets, and finishing in large multiengine Aircrafts (If I recall correctly, some companies do charter even A380!). The alternatives are wide open....

<b>BUT</b>

Every participant <b>is required</b> to report a charter company that features (or is planning to feature) the aircraft of choice :D (So, be prepared to provide an evidence link!)

<b>Important Notes</b>:


*  Regular airlines may include in their business operations Charter modes. These DO NOT qualify as Charter companies, and per se, they will not be taken into account (so forget Lufthansa, for an evidence ... per example)
*   No. You do not need an appropriate livery to participate in the event. If you can and you want to prepare a charter livery, that'll be great. But the lack of livery do not disqualify a participant aircraft

Looking forward to our meeting next Year. Post below your aircraft of choice, or communicate to us in other manner, so we can prepare by completing the participant aircraft list, and we can download the aircrafts on time, and prevent yellow gliders or delays :)

<h2>Route</h2>

We will complete our route to Oregon in two segments; each with a full planned RNAV route. Initially we depart Columbus Ohio Port Columbus airport and fly over the Midwest towards Pierre Regional Airport/Army field in the capital city of South Dakota: Pierre. Secondly, after longing on Pierre's Tarmacs for a rest of 1 h, we will continue our westbound route over the Sierras and approach the City of Portland around the vicinity of the arrogant Mount Hood (Wy'east). These routes will be completed at FL280 and FL300, respectively,  with an expected speed of 0.70Ma
