<b><h2>Wide Body Jet Airliners I : The large of the Family</h2></b>

Last August 22nd, the USA Tour convoy arrived the New England state of Vermont. The flight was unforgettable, and an unbelievable amount of fun; Plus certainly one of the major multiplayer events I had participated at -- with at least 24  pilots cruising the friendly skies together. Lots of great pilotage demostrations, and of great comradery and friendship, we took this opportunity to meet new friends, as we are happy to see the USA Tourist family grow.

As we test the limits of MP servers and infrastructure, we prepare our flight for the following destination. This time, I am very excited to announce the fortieth USA Tour destination will be the awesome Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, which is beautifully modelled in FG, and is one of the greatest FG destinations worldwide. It is also a very large airport with four parallel runways, which are very fit to attempt some parallel landings by our big flock of planes. 

<h3>Aircrafts</h3>

For the third time in a row we will be flying Jet Airliners, while notching the aircraft sizes up. On Leg 38th we flew Regional Jets; a small class of Airliners. On Leg 39th, we flew Narrow body Airliners; Single Aisle aircraft that were consistently larger than those Regional Jets.

Historically speaking, in the 1970's-1980's, the Airlines bussiness expansion gave origin to an interesting market need. Larger aircraft with had the capacity of transporting more passenger, while simultaneously allowing the aircrafts to reach farther destinations. The Wide Body market saw the birth of the Boeing 747-100 and its series, while Airbus followed suit surely close afterwards with the Airbus 300 series. A few other companies reacted a bit later, such as MD with DC10 and MD11, and Lockheed Martin with the TriStar Jet (L1011). Arguably, this later reaction to a market need doom the future of aviation to the Boeing/Airbus competition; which in more modern times added the "low-fuel consumption" requirement to the previously mentioned; which constitutes the most modern series of Airliners with examples such as the Boeing Dreamliner and 777X series, and the Airbus A350XWB. 

So, for the leg 40th, we will notch the aircraft size again, as we will be choosing Wide Body Aircrafts. <b>IMPORTANTLY, a restricition exist that limits the Maximum Take Off Weight of the aircraft of choice to no higher than 785.000 lb (392 TONS)</b>.

This figure shows Wide Body Aircraft by Maximum Passengers allowance and Maximum take of Weight. To be considered participant, you will need to verify with this chart that your aircraft of choice does not exceed the 785.000lb allowance.

To be considered a participant, the aircraft of choice must:

* Be a Jet Airliner used by Commercial Passenger Airliners anywhere in the world/any time in history (also meaning that if a Freight version for any aircraft also exist in FG, only the PAX version qualifies)
* Be a Wide Body Aircraft, with a fuselage wider than 16ft, and more than one passenger aisle configuration
* Not exceed the allowed MTOW of 785.000 Lbs[/list]

This figure summarizes possible aircraft (with their corresponding ICAO codes). These may or may not be available in FGFS.

Keep in mind that particularly Airbus 340-200 and Airbus 340-300 qualified; but the Airbus 340-600 and Airbus 340-600HGW both have higher MTOWs than the admittable limit.
<b>Clarification</b>: Data as reported by Wikipedia, or other specs documentation will/can be considered, regardless of FG aircraft performance or adherence to published specs.

Test your bird, and report! So we can prepare by installing before hand. Besides, I am really curious to know what you are planning to bring this time! :D

<h3>Route</h3>

![img](http://i62.tinypic.com/2wn49ok.png)

In our way to Arizona, we will head west towards the lakes Eerie and Michigan. After overflying them, the J96 route will take us straight accross America Southwesternly all the way to North Arizona, where we will engage in the Eagle (EAGUL6) arrival to our Harbor.
Due to the characteristics of our equipment, we will fly at a high FL400 on a cruising speed of 082MA. We will expect a "en-route" duration of somewhat less than four hours and fifteen minutes.
