Military Advanced Jet Trainers
--------------------------------

The past leg of the USA Tour took us to the mile high city, Denver, Colorado. We flew an all USAF aerospace manufacture military power birds.

This time, in the second consecutive military USA Tour leg, we will be heading from one of the most renowed USA airports to another one that does not trail far behing: the also infamous Chicago O'Hare. The Third USA busiest, sixth in the world by commercial passenger traffic was actually built on the heat of WW-II as one of the most important Air defenses of the country, in the Heart of the -those days- very violent city of Chicago. The O'hare Air Reserve Station remained a joint  military/civilian airport until 1999.

Also, noteworthy, both airports on this USA Tour leg are developed for flightgear, so in addition to some fun air-stunts, we are expecting to see nice developed airports, and aerodromes.

Aircrafts
---------

In our way to the Thirty-seventh state, Illinois, the USA Tour participants  will pilot advanced jet trainer aircraft. 

Any aircraft that has been used for training purposes will apply. But we expect the aircraft to be fast and agile, since we will be doing at least 0.8Ma/FL390. 

Test your bird, and report! So we can prepare by installing before hand. Besides, I am really curious to know what you are planning to bring this time! :D

Wiki offers a rather incomplete list for reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_trainer#List_of_jet_trainers

choose any of these, or other, and be prepared to pull off some evidence that the aircraft chosen is a trainer, or has been used on that service. ;)
