After recently arriving with Jumbo Jets to the State of Nort Carolina, The USA tour completed a series of 4 Passenger-Jet events, beginning with the smallest class of Regional Jets, and increasing its size gradually to fit larger capacity each time. Our convoy arrived to North Carolina after a very succesful and easy flight over the states of Arizona, New Mexico, Arkansas, Missouri and Nebraska, via the J94 airway, and descended to North Carolina using all three Rwys 18R/C/L. Well... almost smooth flight if we discounted the very acrobatic landing performed by IH-COL

This time; We will complete the last USA tour event of the year:  the USA tour leg 42nd is going to switch gears, to a completely different aircraft class: The Helicopter. We will use helicopters that had been used in military service (or government/police) anywhere in the world,  and we will complete a low level (+2500AGL) flight at speeds around 90KTS towards Columbus, Ohio.

We will split the route in two parts. And we will land and rest for about 1 hr in the intermediate stop position in Appalachian Regional Airport. the first half features views form the Appalachian mountains, whereas the second part contrasts by features the Allegheny flats. 

<h2>Aircrafts</h2>

This leg features military used helicopters. Helicopters that have a mixed service (Military and Civilian) are acceptable, and hopefully you can wear the proper dress-code with a suitable military livery.  Goverment and Police usage are going to be considered acceptable as well for the purpose of this leg.

Test your bird, and report! So we can prepare by installing before hand. Besides, I am really curious to know what you are planning to bring this time! :D

Once finished, the USA tour goes for holidays and returns in the month of January to continue our paths.
