Regional Jets
--------------------------------

The Tour made its way to Chicago flying Advanced Jet Trainers. The aircraf look really neat, and the pilots did an amazing job handling the aircraft. Some of these came out of hybernation to participate in the tour, and they definitely are aircraft with a character.

The screenshots I will share soon (eventually) demostrate the point that the USA tour had gained popularity and it is a very fun FG pilot outlet to come and have fun around this great community.

This July, the 38th tour event will take us back to west looking for the largest city of the State of Montana: Billings.

Aircrafts
---------

After two consecutive Military based legs, we will be flying toward the state of Montana in the Regional Jets. These are small jet propelled aircraft that connect the hub airports to destinations of smaller traffic, filling the gaps on the network of commercial air transportation.

To qualify, the aircraft of choice is required to be or had been used by airlines (anywhere in the world), be a Regional Jet class, with a maximum capacity of 125 passengers (top). Aircraft with greater capacity (any seating class!) than this will be considered companionship, not a participant.

The cruising conditions are comfortable for most Regional Jets but they can be adjusted to fit an slower aircraft if this can be considered a participant.

This wiki article reffers to examples of this class, but cannot be considered complete:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regional_airliners#Regional_jets

Don't forget to report what participant aircraft you are considering bringing. This will allow me to update the confirmed aircraft list, and to allow everyone to be prepared day zero.

I am looking forward to share the skies again!
