Recently, The USA tour group made an impressive arrival to the Skyharbor descending from the elevated plains northern to the city of Phoenix; the USA tour leg 40 counted with a record participation, and a very kind acceptance from the Flightgear community -- up to 26 wide body aircraft jetliner completed the epic flight from the town of Burlington, Vermont.

We were honored by the collaboration of KIWI and Omega on the OpenRadar towers, in a way that graciously facilitated the operations of the considerably large group of simulation pilots. Along the way we met new and old timers, we chat friendly, and even sang songs of the area -- with a very well tuned a capella group :P

The large comboy was escorted in some segments by a group of enthusiastic f14 aircrafts that enjoyed waving accross the seemingly busy airspaces. The USA Tour leg 40 was a third consecutive Jet Airliners leg, that began using smaller Regional Jets, bump up to Narrow body aircraft, and continued notching the aircraft size to the common Wide Body Airliners; The big of the family -- those that airlines use, tipically on popular hubs, and to accomodate larger amounts of traffic with efficiency. 

<h3>Aircrafts</h3>

USA Tour Leg 41st will be the fourth consecutive Jet Airliners Leg, and as you may already expect, we are ramping the aircraft size, once again. This time we will fly the largest of the series. Participant aircrafts will include those massive airships that are wide body, and have a unbelievable ability to become airborn while carrying <b>more than 785OOO Lbs of weight (MTOW)</b>. These enormous winged beasts, can even include an additional PAX level to increase occupancy capacity even more. And more surprisingly, frequently these count among the longest ranges in the aviation world. <b>Did you ever see an elephant fly?</b>

To be considered a participant, the aircraft of choice <b>must have a MTOW of  at least  785.000 Lbs</b>

This figure summarizes possible aircraft. These <u>might or might not be available</u> in FGFS.

(The AN225, a freight only variant of the AN124 will be acceptable on replacement of the undeveloped AN124 for FG. <a href="https://github.com/FGMEMBERS/AN-225-Mrija">HerbyW version of the AN225</a> is a highly recommended aircraft!.

The Galaxy C5, a freight only military aircraft capable of lifting on a superb 840OOO Lbs will also be accepted participant for this leg!)

<b>Clarification</b>: Data as reported by Wikipedia, or other specs documentation will/can be considered, regardless of FG aircraft performance or adherence to published specs.

Test your bird, and report! So we can prepare by installing before hand. Besides, I am really curious to know what you are planning to bring this time! :D

<h3>Route</h3>

In our way to the state of North Carolina, we will depart The Phoenix Skyharbor following Maxxo 3 Corona (CNX) Transition, eastbound, and we will follow J74 J46 airways accross the Continental USA at FL370, to Volunteer (VXV). The Standard Arrival Shine 6 will guide our fleet to Charlotte. We will fly south of Alburqueque, NM; Overfly Oklahoma City (IRW) and Tulsa (TUL), OK; and finally we will turns towards Charlotte as we overfly Nashville, TN (BNA) in our path. [I guess this is plenty of heads up for the "USA TOUR <i>a capella</i> group"
