<b>Narrow Body Jet Airliners</b>
--------------------------------

 Last USA Tour event, a large comboy arrived the State of Montana, flying a Regional Jet Airliners Fleet. This huge collection of smaller commercial jets of all generations and nationalities did show our USA Tour proud in the FG map, as we cruised making our compact line of aircrafts over the Midwest; overflying Milkawke, and passing south of Minneapolis, then heading westbound over the boundary of the Dakotas, to our arrival. Flying mostly J34 at around FL300

On the Leg 39, curiously enough, we will almost completely retrace our steps over the Midwest, flying the Airway J34 now on an Odd altitude FL310-FL330. We will overfly the same VORs and radials into Montana, but now out of Montana, all the way to Milwauke, in the VOR BADGER: which was just our North departure from Chicago.  

 From Milwauke, now the USA 39 Leg will continue heading North-east and will, overfly Canadian Territory once again (we flew over Canadian territory in our way to Guam, and in the Return from Anchorage, a few USA Tour events before). Finally, we will head moderately South again, in our descend to the largest City of the Northern State of Vermont: Burlington.

Another interesting Note: The USA Tour Leg 39 will be the first time in USA tour that we depart and arrive Northern border states


Aircrafts
---------

This time, in our way to Vermont we will notch up the size of our selectable aircraft. From Regional Airliners we will migrate to the Single-aisle Jet Airliners, commonly known as narrow-body.   

(at the end of the USA tour, D-07007 noted that single aisle may be a misnomer!)

But What is a Narrow Body Jet Aircraft?
----------------------------------------

Simply put, these are all the Jet Airliners whose <b>fuselage size does not exceed 15 feet</b>, and thus, regardless of the number of abreasts per seat row, only 1 aisle exists for passagers to walk thru.  

Technically speaking all Regional Airliners are also Narrow body, but those with some Range or Pax limitations. But Note that to qualify for the Leg 39th an Aircraft has to comply with all of the following:  

* Be a Jet Airliner used by Commercial Passenger Airliners anywhere in the world/any time in history (also meaning that if a Freight version for any aircraft also exist in FG, only the PAX version qualifies)
* Be a Narrow Body aircraft, with only 1 aisle, and a fuselage with not exceeding 15 ft
* Have a Minimum capacity of 120 passengers in at least one of the flying classes configurations (excluding all of the qualified Regional Jets in leg
38th!)

Wiki offers a rather incomplete list for reference (only jet-engines applies):<br>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft

Flightgear offers many optionable Aircraft among the FGers favorites: These include (again, not a complete list!)

* Boeing 707, 717, 727,  737, 757
* DC8, DC9
* Airbus A320-family (neo), 
* Tupolev 214
* Concorde (may be faster than required) 
* Bombardier CSeries
* Probably several others

Test your bird, and report! So we can prepare by installing before
hand. Besides, I am really curious to know what you are planning to bring this
time! :D
